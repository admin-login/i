            "text": "An IP address - Internet Protocol address - is a sequence of numbers that identifies any device or computer on a network. Computers use IP addresses to communicate with each other both over the internet as well as on other networks.
      
      192.168.10.1 is known as a private, local, or gateway IP address that is considered the head of your network. 192.168.10.1 is used to both access your router’s interface and to allow smart devices to connect to the router.
      
      You can think of your router's IP address as a PO box for your mail. Any packages you receive through the post office go directly to your PO box, though instead of you going to collect, your router will then send the post to the computer device that requested it."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Your router has the role to connect two worlds and “route” data between your local network and the outside network - most of the time the internet. At each end, namely the network ports, your router will get assigned an IP address.
      The external port that connects your router with the external world is called WAN - Wide Area Network - and it gets a Public IP address.
      
      The internal network port is called LAN port - Local Area Network - and it gets a private IP address. Usually, this address is by default 192.168.10.1 IP address, and therefore only people connected to your network can see this IP address. Even though the router's private IP address is not unique to the device, in one network segment no 2 devices can use the same IP address. Please pay attention that there are no spaces included with the IP address, so 192.168 10.1 is not a correct IP.
      
      For example in your LAN, your router has 192.168.10.1 IP address, your computer gets 192.168.10.10 IP address, your mobile phone (when connected to Wi-Fi) gets 192.168.10.11 IP address and your printer gets 192.168.10.100 IP address.
      By using these IP addresses that uniquely identify the devices in a network, the router knows where and how to route data packets for each device and not mix them up.
      
      You are entitled to ask who is deciding who is assigning those IP addresses? What are the rules when assigning them?
      
      Those four sets of numbers separated by dots are also called IPv4 addresses and certain numbers are reserved to be used as private IP addresses. IANA or Internet Assigned Numbers Authority reserved certain ranges of IP’s to be used as private IP addresses. Those ranges reserved for private use are:
      
      From 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
      From 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
      From 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
      Basically, we are talking about 18 million private IP's, but manufacturers still use a very small set when they decide the default IP address on their devices."

            "text": "As explained, your private IP address, such as 192.168.10.1, can be assigned to your router by default by the manufacturer. If you are not sure of your default IP, you can often find it detailed on the base of your router, in the user manual that came with the router, or via the manufacturer’s website.
      Some websites can show you the necessary details for your router's make and model. With a simple google search, you can locate such sites.
      If that’s not possible, you can use your computer device to find your router’s IP address."
