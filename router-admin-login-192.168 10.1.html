          To be able to connect to your router, you need to follow a few steps.
          Some steps probably are already done:

        <!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
        <ol>
          <li>
            Get your router out of the box and check the default username and
            password in the user manual or on the label at the base of the
            device.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check the internet connection by plugging the included ethernet
            cable into your computer or laptop.
          </li>
          <li>Plugin the router to a power source.</li>
          <li>
            The default network name should be the make and model of the router.
            Check the user manual if you have trouble finding it.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <!-- /wp:list -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Now you shall be ready to connect to the admin interface.</p>

        <p>
          The dashboard panel is where you can adjust the settings of your
          router and wireless network. You will be able to fine-tune the
          router’s configuration or change some settings altogether. The admin
          panel is letting you define or change the username and password for
          the router.

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          <strong>Passwords are the key</strong> to almost everything nowadays,
          and you probably have multiple passwords that you use throughout the
          day. When it comes to your router password you shall be very careful.
          Imagine a hacker breaching your router and installing malicious
          software that will capture your most sensitive data (or money from
          online banking!). For sure you don’t want that. In this respect be
          wise and change your default password with a solid 12 to 16 characters
          password.
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          Complexity counts, even though some might find complex passwords hard
          to remember, are hard to guess even by brute force. General practice
          is to use capitals, special characters, and numbers in your password.
          If you are afraid you are not going to remember your password you can
          always use a trusted password manager. Some suggestions are listed
          below:

          <strong>Changing the router default IP address</strong>
        </h2>
        <!-- /wp:heading -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          There are multiple reasons, one might want to change the default IP
          address of the router, and most of them are related to security.
          Anyway, before changing your router’s local IP address, make sure you
          take note of that new IP address. After changing the IP address you
          won’t be able to use 192.168.10.1 address to access your router.
          Instead, you will have to use the new IP address that you just
          changed. In order to change the IP address you have to follow the
          following steps:
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the setup or admin menu option</li>
          <li>Look for the network settings.</li>
          <li>Under the router settings, type in your desired IP address</li>
          <li>Save or apply the changes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="changing-the-default-name-of-the-wifi-network">
          <strong>Changing the default name of the WiFi network</strong>
        </h2>
        <!-- /wp:heading -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          Because, most likely, you want to differentiate your Wi-Fi network
          from the other WiFi networks nearby, you change WiFi network name. In
          order to do so, make sure you choose a descriptive, friendly and not
          offensive network name to use. In order to do so you need to locate
          the WiFi setup area of your router menu:
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the setup or admin menu option</li>
          <li>Look for the WiFi network settings.</li>
          <li>Click on the options and look for SSID</li>
          <li>Change the current SSID with your desired network name</li>
          <li>Click save or apply</li>
        </ol>
        <!-- /wp:list -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          Once you apply the changes, the router will restart and all the WiFi
          connected devices will lose connection with the router. In this
          respect, you will have to make sure you reconnect on the new WiFi.

          <strong>Creating a guest WiFi network</strong>
        </h2>
        <!-- /wp:heading -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          New router models have included this feature to be able to run
          multiple WiFi networks with a single device. This is such a useful
          thing to do, especially for security reasons, when you have guests in
          your home or office that need to connect to a WiFi network to access
          the internet. Since you don’t trust those devices are not infected,
          and therefore to protect your main network from attacks, you better
          create this separate guest network.
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          If you decide to create such a guest network, you will still need to
          apply security measures in order to make it secure and not be
          vulnerable to hackers.
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          Maintaining the security of your main network and guest network shall
          be a priority when setting things up.
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          The option to create guest networks is generally available in the WiFi
          network section of your router and depends on the brand or
          manufacturer. With the new guest network, your IP address will be
          different from the 192.168.10.1 IP address.
