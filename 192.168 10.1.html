          Your router is the manager of the office or home
          <strong>Wi-Fi network</strong>. Taking the new router directly from
          the box and connecting it into the power might give you a basic
          network - some routers come pre-programmed, for instant use, or the
          router might need configuring.
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          For either case, as the preset network is less than suitable, you are
          initially required to login to your router at 192.168.10.1. In order
          to log in, you will need your router username and passwords before you
          can start to obtain a new network setup.

          In some cases, the installment was done for you by your internet

          require to login to 192.168.10.1, to carry out updates or various
          other changes.

            In order to connect to your router, you need to activate a computer
            system with internet accessibility, such as your smartphone, tablet,
            personal computer, or laptop computer. With the smart tool in hand,
            attach it to your router. For a smartphone or tablet, you can
            utilize the Wi-Fi network to connect. Nonetheless, a computer system
            or laptop computer attached to the router with a wired ethernet link
            is the best option to ensure connection stability.

            As soon as you have entered 192.168.10.1 (and not 192.168 10.1), you

          If you ever forget the login details or the router, for example, you
          can reset the router, though this will additionally reset any various
          other adjustments that were made previously. A common method to reset
          your router is described below, though the process may vary depending

            With the router powered on, press and hold the reset button that is
            typically on the back. You might require a pen pointer or paper clip
            to hold this button for 30 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the reset button is held down, disconnect the router from the
            power source and wait 30 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            While maintaining the reset button, reconnect the router to the
            power source and wait an additional 30 secs.

          <li>
            Once done, go back to the router's user interface - web page - and

          When it comes to your router password you shall be very careful.
          Imagine a hacker breaching your router and installing malicious
          software that will capture your most sensitive data (or money from
          online banking!). For sure you don’t want that. In this respect be
          wise and change your default password with a solid 12 to 16 characters

          Anyway, before changing your router’s local IP address, make sure you

          Because, most likely, you want to differentiate your Wi-Fi network

          New router models have included this feature to be able to run
          multiple WiFi networks with a single device. This is such a useful
          thing to do, especially for security reasons, when you have guests in
          your home or office that need to connect to a WiFi network to access
          the internet. Since you don’t trust those devices are not infected,
          and therefore to protect your main network from attacks, you better
          create this separate guest network.
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          If you decide to create such a guest network, you will still need to

          The option to create guest networks is generally available in the WiFi
          network section of your router and depends on the brand or

          different from the 192.168.10.1 IP address.

          An IP address - Internet Protocol address - is a sequence of numbers
          that identifies any device or computer on a network. Computers use IP
          addresses to communicate with each other both over the internet as
          well as on other networks.

          <strong>192.168.10.1</strong> is known as a private, local, or gateway
          IP address that is considered the head of your network.
          <strong>192.168.10.1</strong> is used to both access your router’s
          interface and to allow smart devices to connect to the router.

          You can think of your router's IP address as a PO box for your mail.
          Any packages you receive through the post office go directly to your

          Your router has the role to connect two worlds and “route” data
          between your local network and the outside network - most of the time
          the internet. At each end, namely the network ports, your router will
          get assigned an IP address.<br />The external port that connects your
          router with the external world is called WAN - Wide Area Network - and
          it gets a Public IP address.
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          The internal network port is called LAN port - Local Area Network -
          and it gets a private IP address. Usually, this address is by default
          192.168.10.1 IP address, and therefore only people connected to your
          network can see this IP address. Even though the router's private IP
          address is not unique to the device, in one network segment no 2
          devices can use the same IP address. Please pay attention that there
          are no spaces included with the IP address, so 192.168 10.1 is not a
          correct IP.
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          For example in your LAN, your router has 192.168.10.1 IP address, your
          computer gets 192.168.10.10 IP address, your mobile phone (when
          connected to Wi-Fi) gets 192.168.10.11 IP address and your printer
          gets 192.168.10.100 IP address.
        </p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>
          <br />By using these IP addresses that uniquely identify the devices
          in a network, the router knows where and how to route data packets for
          each device and not mix them up.

          As explained, your private IP address, such as 192.168.10.1, can be
          assigned to your router by default by the manufacturer. If you are not
          sure of your default IP, you can often find it detailed on the base of
          your router, in the user manual that came with the router, or via the
          manufacturer’s website.<br />Some websites can show you the necessary
          details for your router's make and model. With a simple google search,
          you can locate such sites.<br />If that’s not possible, you can use
          your computer device to find your router’s IP address.

          IP address misspellings are very common because they are not so easy
          to type due to the digits and symbols structure. In order to avoid
          these types of misspellings, it is better to copy and paste the IP
          into the browser navigation bar. The most common misspelled IP is
          192.168 10.1, having an extra space instead of a dot.

          Some routers need a physical cable connection in order to be able to
          access the 192.168.10.1 config dashboard. Some routers include this
          cable within the package box they are being sold. When connecting the
          cable to the router, please make sure you are connecting to the
          correct router port as specified in the user manual. If the user
          manual for the router is not available, you can try by connecting it
          first to the LAN port.

      192.168.10.1 is known as a private, local, or gateway IP address that is considered the head of your network. 192.168.10.1 is used to both access your router’s interface and to allow smart devices to connect to the router.
      
      You can think of your router's IP address as a PO box for your mail. Any packages you receive through the post office go directly to your PO box, though instead of you going to collect, your router will then send the post to the computer device that requested it."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Your router has the role to connect two worlds and “route” data between your local network and the outside network - most of the time the internet. At each end, namely the network ports, your router will get assigned an IP address.
      The external port that connects your router with the external world is called WAN - Wide Area Network - and it gets a Public IP address.
      
      The internal network port is called LAN port - Local Area Network - and it gets a private IP address. Usually, this address is by default 192.168.10.1 IP address, and therefore only people connected to your network can see this IP address. Even though the router's private IP address is not unique to the device, in one network segment no 2 devices can use the same IP address. Please pay attention that there are no spaces included with the IP address, so 192.168 10.1 is not a correct IP.
      
      For example in your LAN, your router has 192.168.10.1 IP address, your computer gets 192.168.10.10 IP address, your mobile phone (when connected to Wi-Fi) gets 192.168.10.11 IP address and your printer gets 192.168.10.100 IP address.
      By using these IP addresses that uniquely identify the devices in a network, the router knows where and how to route data packets for each device and not mix them up.
      
      You are entitled to ask who is deciding who is assigning those IP addresses? What are the rules when assigning them?
      
      Those four sets of numbers separated by dots are also called IPv4 addresses and certain numbers are reserved to be used as private IP addresses. IANA or Internet Assigned Numbers Authority reserved certain ranges of IP’s to be used as private IP addresses. Those ranges reserved for private use are:
      
      From 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
      From 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
      From 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
      Basically, we are talking about 18 million private IP's, but manufacturers still use a very small set when they decide the default IP address on their devices."

            "text": "As explained, your private IP address, such as 192.168.10.1, can be assigned to your router by default by the manufacturer. If you are not sure of your default IP, you can often find it detailed on the base of your router, in the user manual that came with the router, or via the manufacturer’s website.
      Some websites can show you the necessary details for your router's make and model. With a simple google search, you can locate such sites.
      If that’s not possible, you can use your computer device to find your router’s IP address."
